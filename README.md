In this pratical application, I built linear regression models to identify key factors that can impact the price of a used car.
The dataset includes informations of the price from 250K used cars and multiple columns with information that may be relevant to the price.


The following findings are derived from an extensive dataset comprising nearly half a million car sales. The initial phase of the analysis involved data cleansing and removal of outliers.

The average sale price for a used car stands at approximately $17,000, resulting in a total market volume of $5.8 billion.

Key Insights: Low-End vs. High-End Markets
Upon meticulous examination, it is evident that the used car market can be primarily categorized into two dominant segments, namely the low-end and the high-end vehicle markets, accounting for the majority of the revenue in used car sales. This categorization was accomplished through a clustering analysis, meticulously grouping members into each segment.

The low-end market reflects a total value of $1.78 billion, with an average sale price of approximately $13,000 and encompasses approximately 40% of all car sales.

Conversely, the high-end market boasts a total value of $3.53 billion, with an average sale price of $25,000 and represents 42% of all car sales.

Although both market segments depict a similar volume of sales, the total market value of the higher-end market rivals that of the lower-end market, being twice as significant.

The high-end market portrays a broader price range, indicating a greater flexibility in pricing. A majority of sales fall within the $17,000 to $40,000 range. While there are outliers in the low-end segment, these instances often involve vehicle transfers at no cost, such as within family members.

Conversely, the low-end market showcases less variability and is centered around its average value, indicative of limited pricing flexibility within this segment.

Attributes of the Low-End Market
A correlation analysis reveals distinct customer preferences within the low-end market:
- Preference for automatic transmission
- Emphasis on excellent vehicle condition
- Predominance of gas as the preferred fuel type
- Preference for newer model years

Conversely, there is a lesser inclination towards:
- Non-automatic transmissions
- Vehicles in good condition
- Fuel types other than gas
- 4-cylinder engines

Hence, an ideal vehicle in the low-end market constitutes a gas-powered vehicle with automatic transmission in good condition, preferably a newer model. Notably, mileage carries less significance.

Attributes of the High-End Market
Similarly, discernible customer inclinations within the high-end market comprise:
- Preference for non-automatic transmissions
- Emphasis on newer model years
- Predominance of good vehicle condition
- Inclination towards alternative fuel types

Conversely, there is reduced preference for:
- Vehicles with automatic transmission
- Higher odometer readings
- Vehicles in excellent condition
- Full-size vehicles
- Gas as the fuel type

These multifaceted characteristics reflect a broader customer base, implicating a degree of diversity within this segment. Hence, the ideal vehicle within the high-end market is comparatively more fluid, albeit tending away from automatic transmission, predicated upon good condition and lower mileage.

Enhancing Car Sales Performance
The choice of market segment profoundly influences the anticipated average sale price and sales volume. Both the low-end and high-end markets exhibit considerable potential value, yet vehicles aligning with the high-end market profile attract a broader customer base and command higher prices. Moreover, higher-end vehicles tend to demonstrate more consistent sales performance at superior price points. Thus, optimizing car sales efficiency necessitates a strategic focus on procuring and merchandising vehicles aligned with the high-end market profile.
